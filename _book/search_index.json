If youre like me, you cant help but bookmark every R-related programming book you find in the hopes that one day you, or someone you know, might find it useful. Hopefully this is the only bookmark youll need in future ;). When I initially released this collection in late August 2020, it contained about 100 books that Id been collecting over the previous two years. Since then Ive found a few more and there have been contributions from many people. The collection now stands at about 250 books. Most of these are free. Some are paid but usually quite affordable. 1.2 Searching If theres something specific youre looking for, use the menu or search using the magnifying glass icon at the top of the screen. 1.3 Contributing Please feel free to contribute paid and free books - see GitHub. 1.4 Contributors If youve contributed, add your name and Twitter / blog link below! Oscar Baruffa, Mohit Sharma, Vebash Naidoo, Julia Silge, Erik Gahner Larsen, Nicole Radziwill, Nistara Randhawa, Antoine Fabri, Jon Calder, Mike Smith, Ben Bolker, Maëlle Salmon, Laura Ellis, Bryan Shalloway, Antonio Uzal, Louis Aslett, Lluís Revilla Sancho, Brendan Cullen, Rami Krispin, Michael Dorman, Ezekiel Adebayo Ogundepo, Shamsuddeen Hassan Muhammad, Eric Leung, Isabella Velásquez, Matt Roumaya, Legana Fingerhut, Robert D.

Im guessing that if youre interested in R then you also like data ;). I initially used Google Analytics for this site but as Im keen to enhance user privacy I switched to Plausible Analytics from 30 December 2020 onward. You can view the old Google Analytics summary report PDF here. TLDR 22k unique visitors and 33k sessions between August 2020 and December 2020 :D!! Note that unique visits will be higher in Plausible than youd find with Google Analytics. Because Plausible is GDPR compliant and privacy focused, each user is identified for only 1 day. If someone visits the site 2 days in a row, thats counted as 2 uniques whereas in Google Analytics it would only be counted as 1 unique visitor because of the presence of persistent cookies and such that allows for tracking of users. From now on, you can view the LIVE site stats right here. 1.7 About me Im Oscar. Fairly new to R and loving it. If you like this book, feel free to say Hi! on Twitter.

If you arent sure where to start, then try one of these two options: 2.0.1 Book: R for Data Science This book is an excellent introduction to R programming and gets you started with visualizing data so you see some exciting stuff, and the power of R, right away. The book is free to read at https://r4ds.had.co.nz/ Theres an accompanying exercise solution book at https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/ For a different take on the solutions, check out Yet another R for Data Science study guide which can also be found at https://brshallo.github.io/r4ds_solutions/ If youd like more of a roadmap which incorporates this book, have a look at my blogpost: https://oscarbaruffa.com/a-roadmap-for-getting-started-with-r/ 2.0.2 Video Course: Getting started with R If you prefer video instruction with progress tracking, check out this course from R for the Rest of Us called Getting Started with R. https://rfortherestofus.com/courses/getting-started/ "],["archeology.html", "3 Archeology 3.1 How To Do Archaeological Science Using R 3.2 Quantitative Methods in Archaeology Using R", " 3 Archeology 3.1 How To Do Archaeological Science Using R by Ben Marwick (editor) Archaeological science is becoming increasingly complex, and progress in this area is slowed by critical limitation of journal articles lacking the space to communicate new methods in enough detail to allow others to reproduce and reuse new research. One solution to this is to use a programming language such as R to analyse archaeological data, with authors sharing their R code with their publications to communicate our methods. This practice is becoming widespread in many other disciplines, but few archaeologists currently know how to use R or have an opportunity to learn during their training. In this forum we tackle this problem by discussing ubiquitous research methods of immediate relevance to most archaeologists, by using interactive, live-coded demonstrations of R code by archaeologists who program with R. Topics include getting data into R, working with C14 dates, spatial analysis and map-making, conducting simulations, and exploratory data visualizations. Link: https://benmarwick.github.io/How-To-Do-Archaeological-Science-Using-R/ 3.2 Quantitative Methods in Archaeology Using R The first hands-on guide to using the R statistical computing system written specifically for archaeologists. It shows how to use the system to analyze many types of archaeological data. Part I includes tutorials on R, with applications to real archaeological data showing how to compute descriptive statistics, create tables, and produce a wide variety of charts and graphs. Part II addresses the major multivariate approaches used by archaeologists, including multiple regression (and the generalized linear model); multiple analysis of variance and discriminant analysis; principal components analysis; correspondence analysis; distances and scaling; and cluster analysis. Part III covers specialized topics in archaeology, including intra-site spatial analysis, seriation, and assemblage diversity.

Something that the R community calls Rtistry. My Rtistry journey so far has been an amazing and tranquil expedition into a world that seemed intimidating and scary on the outside but is honestly just a bottomless pit of fun and creativity on the inside. Im going to talk about some very basic concepts and perspectives you can think about while starting your own Rtistry journey in ggplot. This includes basics on geoms, aesthetics, layering, etc. But then Im also going to walk you through two of my Rtistry examples and code to get you started. This article is intended for those who have some experience with ggplot building in R but may not have realized how to transition from making regular visuals to Rtistry. This article goes over basic concepts that more seasoned users may already know.

Many of these tools are readily and freely available in R. This full-day session will provide participants with a hands-on training on how to use data analytics tools and machine learning methods available in R to explore, visualize, and model big data. Link: https://okanbulut.github.io/bigdata/ 5.2 Mastering Spark with R by Javier Luraschi, Kevin Kuo, Edgar Ruiz In this book you will learn how to use Apache Spark with R. The book intends to take someone unfamiliar with Spark or R and help you become proficient by teaching you a set of tools, skills and practices applicable to large-scale data science.
